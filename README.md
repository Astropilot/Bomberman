## First Part - SDL

For the first part of the project, we had to focus on the SDL graphics library. In order to be able to make the game, we have designed a generic framework that can be reused for other graphic projects.

## Second Part - Multiplayer / Network

For this second part, it is also a question here of creating a framework embedding a battery of functions allowing to create as quickly and simply as possible a client/server architecture for video games.

## Third Part - The Game

Finally, we made the famous Bomberman game based on our two frameworks.
